After a recent switch to new server hardware, I've discovered that Nextcloud wasn't performing better than before although the hardware and software configuration got better by a lot which pointed to a bottleneck somewhere else. Because of my findings, I've decided to create a new FAQ guide how to improve the performance of your Nextcloud installation. You can find it [here](/docs/improve-performance)
