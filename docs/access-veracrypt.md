Next, you should open the encrypted external data SSD/HDD on a different PC to be able to copy files or create the sensible folder structure.

1. **Power off** your server by pressing the `power button`
1. **Disconnect** the external data SSD/HDD
1. **Don`t** connect the drive to your PC, yet
1. **Download** Veracrypt from [here](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html) and **install** it on your PC (if needed, **restart** your PC)
1. Now, **connect** the drive to your PC (choose to **not** reformat the drive if you get a popup, that it must get reformatted)
1. Open `Veracrypt`, select the drive, type in the **password** and wait until it is mounted to your system<br/>
(Here is a guide how to do that in detail: [click here](https://tdicomputing.dartmouth.edu/veracrypt-mounting-encrypted-volumes-containers/#windows))

Now you should be able to access the encrypted drive.
