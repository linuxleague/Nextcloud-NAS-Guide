There is an app for Nextcloud that lets you annotate and edit PDF files. It is not represented in the store and needs some additional packages, hence we made it easy to install.

Here is how you can install it:
1. Run over CLI:
    ```shell
    sudo bash /var/scripts/menu.sh
    ```
1. Choose `Additional Apps` -> `PDF Annotations`
1. Choose to install/reinstall `PDF Annotations`
1. Wait until it reports that it was successfully installed

Now you should be able to edit and comment PDF files in your Nextcloud.
