Nextcloud 18 introduced the so-called `workspaces`. This shows a readme file on top of any folder in Nextcloud which will be disturbing for most users, so you should disable them if you have no usecase for them.

1. Run over CLI:
    ```shell
    sudo bash /var/scripts/menu.sh
    ```
1. Choose `Nextcloud Configuration` -> `Disable workspaces`
1. Choose to disable `rich workspaces`

Rich workspaces are now disabled.
