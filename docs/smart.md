Since disks can fail, you should get notified as soon as possible if a disk error is found, so you should set up disk monitoring. 

Please note: this is no alternative to a backup solution!
1. Run `sudo bash /var/scripts/menu.sh` over CLI
1. Choose `Server Configuration` -> `Disk Monitoring`
1. Choose to install/reinstall **S.M.A.R.T Monitoring**
1. Choose **Directly** to get informed instantly if a disk error was found
