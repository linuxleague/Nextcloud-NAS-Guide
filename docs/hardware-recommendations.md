title: Do you have any Hardware recommendations?
sidebar_label: Hardware recommendations

Since your server shall run 24/7, it makes sense to use laptop CPU's and hardware because those are still much more power efficient than any custom-built PC. Perfect because of the size and power for this usecase are Intel NUC's. 

Recommended are any recent Intel NUC's with 4 or more cores. Click on [this link](https://geizhals.eu/?cat=barepc&v=e&hloc=at&hloc=de&hloc=pl&hloc=uk&hloc=eu&sort=p&bl1_id=30&xf=15825_4%7E2257_Intel%7E3345_2018#gh_filterbox) to show recommended devices. Of course you are free to buy used devices, but again: Intel NUC's are prefered.

After you have chosen your device, you will need to get compatible RAM and Storage for your NUC which depends on the model that you've chosen. So please choose wisely.

## Recommended is:
- One Intel NUC from 2018 or later with 4 Cores or more
- One SO-DIMM RAM bar with 8GB because 8GB should be enough for now and you will be able to upgrade the RAM with a second bar later on 
- One internal SSD with 250 GB which should be plenty of storage for this usecase
- One (or more) external SSD (or HDD) for storing the private data with at least 1TB (depending on how much data you are planning to store on your server. Rule of thumb: this drive should be at least twice as big as your current private data)
- Two external HDD's for backups with at least the same size like the external data SSD/HDD, respectively
