Currently (10. Nov. 2020) supported are:

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
- [deSEC](https://desec.io)
- [Duck DNS](https://duckdns.org)
- [Strato](https://strato.de) (recommended for german users) (if you choose a `.de` domain, it should be around `0.80â‚¬` per month from the 2nd year on and much cheaper in the first year. Other good options are e.g. `.com` and `.eu` domains but also a bit more pricey.)
