In order to improve the security of your files, you can monitor public link shares that get created via Nextcloud. This is especially useful if you as admin want to get notified as soon as any new public link is created. It won't work for any other type of shares like email shares or federated shares, though. So this option only makes sense if the other mentioned share options are disabled on your Nextcloud instance.

Here is how to configure it:
1. Run over CLI:
    ```shell
    sudo bash /var/scripts/not-supported.sh
    ```
1. Choose `Monitor Link Shares`
1. Choose to install `Monitor Link Shares`
1. Now it should report that it was successfully installed
