The idea concerning this guide is that you can read and work through the whole guide starting here until the whole initial setup is done (it ends [here](./congratulations)). In the end you will have a working Nextcloud NAS.

It is not recommended to skip anything until the whole initial setup is done, because the sections partly build on each other. So simply read and work through everything starting here!
