Although a SMB-server might not be needed in any installation, it is recommended to configure it nonetheless, since you will be able to `create Nextcloud users` and configure the `Nextcloud external storage` app easily using the SMB-server script.

This section should take around **20min** if you just create a few users and shares. It covers:
1. Run the smb-server script
1. Create SMB-users and Nextcloud users
1. Create SMB-shares and mount the locations to Nextcloud
