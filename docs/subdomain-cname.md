In order to install OnlyOffice Documentserver or Talk High-performance backend, you need to create a subdomain and point with a CNAME-entry to your Nextcloud Domain.

How to do this highly depends on your service provider.
Here is the documentation for some pre-chosen providers:

### Strato
1. [Create a subdomain](https://www.strato.de/faq/domains/subdomains-anlegen-und-loeschen/#subdomain_anlegen)
1. [Edit the CNAME entry for subdomains](https://www.strato.com/faq/en_us/domain/this-is-how-you-can-change-the-cname-entry-for-your-subdomain/) and type in your Nextcloud Domain. (You can find your subdomains by clicking on the small Plus icon next to your Domain. And don't forget to add a dot at the end of the domain that you type in! This is somehow missing in their documentation!)
