You will need to port forward some specific ports to your server in order to make it possible to run a public webserver on it.<br/>
(**Hint**: Most likely is your server internally called `nextcloud`; Otherwise you can identify your server by its internal IP-address e.g. `192.168.178.144`)

How to do port forwarding in detail, completely depends on your router. Thus, you should inspect your router's manual for that.
#### Here are some guides for different router models:
- [FRITZ!Box 7590](https://en.avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7590/knowledge-base/publication/show/893_Setting-up-static-port-sharing/) (only point 2 of this guide is needed)
#### You will need to port forward at least the following two ports to your server:
- Port 80 TCP
- Port 443 TCP<br/>
