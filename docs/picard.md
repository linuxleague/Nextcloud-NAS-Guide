sidebar_label: Edit Audio/Music metadata

MusicBrains Picard is a program for Linux that lets you change the metadata of our Audio/Music files. This can become handy if the metadata was written falsely or not at all during the ripping of a CD or if you got the files from somewhere else and now want to change the metadata to be more correct.

Fortunately there is already a good guide available on this so that we don't need to write one ourselves. You can find it here: https://www.radioking.com/blog/easily-edit-metadata-musicbrainz-picard/
